# Main

## Project Overview
This project is a Roblox game built using Luau scripting. It is structured to separate client, server, and shared code for better organization and maintainability.

## Project Structure
The project follows this structure:
```
.gitignore
aftman.toml
default.project.json
	client/
		init.client.luau
	server/
		init.server.luau
	shared/
		Hello.luau
	shared/
		Hello.luau
```

- **`src/client`**: Contains scripts that run on the client side.
- **`src/server`**: Contains scripts that run on the server side.
- **`src/shared`**: Contains code shared between the client and server.

## Coding Style Guide
To maintain consistency and readability, follow these guidelines:
1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Name variables, functions, and files clearly to describe their purpose.
2. **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.
3. **Comments**: Add comments to explain complex logic or important sections of the code.
4. **Avoid Global Variables**: Use local variables to prevent conflicts.
5. **Organize Code**: Group related functions and logic together.

### Example
```luau
	print("Hello, " .. name .. "!")
local function greet(name)
	print("Hello, " .. name .. "!")
end

greet("Player")
```
